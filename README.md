# jQuery Blood Code
This is a jQuery Konami Code inspired jQuery plugin for adding Easter eggs to a website via the blood code from Mortal Kombat 1. If you aren't familiar with Mortal Kombat 1 then you probably don't care much about this.

At this point the code is very old but it still works, at least with the particular version of jQuery this was built against (1.8.2).

jQuery is included via `googleapis` URL and can be seen in the example `index.html`.

## Usage
There is an example included that demonstrates usage. Open up `example/index.html` and enter the blood code on your keyboard (a b a c a b b) and see what happens. See `example/js/init.js` to see how the plugin is wired up.
